The dataset includes 1492 images.
Pupila-iris-Eyes-Pupil-Iris are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -45 and +45 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 7 percent of pixels
